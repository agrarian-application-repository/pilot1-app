# Inference Configuration

# str: Path to the model checkpoint file (required).
# Specifies the .pt file for the model to be used during inference.
model: experiments/example_train_run/weights/best.pt

# str: Data source for inference.
# Can be an image path, video file, directory, URL, or device ID (for live feeds).
# Supports various input formats such as images, videos, and streams.

# Range: Any positive integer.
vid_stride: 1

# bool: Use stream buffering for video streams.
# If true, queues new frames to avoid dropping frames but may cause latency.
stream_buffer: false

# bool: Visualize model features during inference.
# Activates feature maps visualization for model interpretability or debugging.
visualize: false

# bool: Enable test-time augmentation (TTA) during inference.
# Improves detection robustness by augmenting inputs, at the cost of slower inference.
augment: false

# bool: Enable class-agnostic Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
# Treats all classes equally during NMS, merging overlapping boxes regardless of class.
agnostic_nms: false

# list[int]: Filter detections by specific class IDs.
# Only predictions belonging to the specified class IDs will be returned.

# Useful for applications such as clustering or similarity search.
embed: null

# bool: Display annotated images or videos in a window.
# Provides immediate visual feedback during inference.
show: false

# bool: Save annotated images or videos to a file.
# Allows saving the output with detected objects for later analysis or sharing.
save: true

# Useful for frame-by-frame analysis or extracting specific frames.
save_frames: false

# bool: Save detection results in a text file.
# Format: [class] [x_center] [y_center] [width] [height] [confidence].
save_txt: false

# bool: Save confidence scores in the text output file.
# Adds confidence values to each detection result for more detailed analysis.
save_conf: false

# Crops and saves individual detections, useful for dataset augmentation or analysis.
save_crop: false

# bool: Display labels for each detected object.
# Provides class labels alongside detected objects for better understanding.
show_labels: true

# bool: Display confidence scores for each detected object.
# Shows the model's confidence for each prediction, giving insight into detection certainty.
show_conf: true

# bool: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
# Essential for visualizing where objects are located in the image or video frame.

# None or int: Line width for bounding boxes.
# If None, the line width is automatically adjusted based on image size.
# Range: None or any positive integer.
line_width: null
